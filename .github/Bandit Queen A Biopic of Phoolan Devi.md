Phoolan Devi was born on 10 August 1963 in a small village called Gorha Ka Purwa in the Jalaun district of Uttar Pradesh. She belonged to the Mallah caste, which was considered low and inferior by the dominant castes in the region. She faced discrimination, poverty, and violence from a young age. She was married off at the age of 11 to a much older man named Puttilal, who abused and abandoned her. She returned to her village, but faced more humiliation and ostracism from her family and community.
 
She joined a gang of bandits led by Babu Gujjar, who kidnapped her and raped her. She was later rescued by another bandit leader named Vikram Mallah, who became her lover and protector. Together, they formed their own gang and raided upper-caste villages, looting and killing their oppressors. They also became popular among the lower castes, who saw them as heroes and defenders. Phoolan Devi earned the nickname of "Bandit Queen" for her courage and charisma.
 
In 1981, Phoolan Devi was betrayed by one of her gang members, Lala Ram, who joined forces with another bandit leader named Sri Ram. They attacked Phoolan's gang and killed Vikram Mallah. They also captured Phoolan and gang-raped her for several days in a village called Behmai. Phoolan managed to escape with the help of some villagers and vowed to take revenge. She regrouped with some of her loyal followers and attacked Behmai again in 1982, killing 22 Thakur men who were allegedly involved in her rape.
 
This incident made her a national sensation and a wanted criminal. The police launched a massive manhunt to capture her, but she evaded them for several months. She finally surrendered in 1983 after negotiating a deal with the government that promised her a reduced sentence and better prison conditions. She was charged with 48 crimes, including murder, kidnapping, robbery, and arson. She spent 11 years in jail, during which she endured torture, harassment, and isolation.
 
She was released on parole in 1994 after the state government withdrew all charges against her. She decided to enter politics and joined the Samajwadi Party, which represented the interests of the lower castes and minorities. She contested and won the Lok Sabha elections from Mirzapur constituency in Uttar Pradesh in 1996. She lost her seat in 1998, but regained it in 1999. She advocated for the rights of women, Dalits, and other marginalized groups. She also worked for social welfare schemes such as education, health care, and employment.
